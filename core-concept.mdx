### Get Tools

The `get-tools` concept allows us to retrieve all tools that are available and connected to the platform. This provides a complete overview of all capabilities your agent can access.

### Tool Call

Tool Call is a unified endpoint through which we can call absolutely any tool with any arguments. This single interface works with any tool we've connected to the platform, eliminating the need for multiple integration points.

### UI Components

With every tool response, we automatically receive UI components that can be dynamically displayed with the data. The response includes JSX React code and the props for these components with data already prepared for rendering. This completely eliminates any need to worry about serialization on the frontend.

### Memory  
Agents should be as personal as possible, regardless of where you are working.

These four core concepts work together to create a seamless integration experience that drastically simplifies how agents interact with external tools and services.
