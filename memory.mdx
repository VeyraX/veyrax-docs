Memory is a powerful tool that enables agents to remember important information across sessions. By storing key details, preferences, and context, agents can provide more personalized and efficient assistance without requiring you to repeat information.

## Adding to Memory

There are two simple ways to add information to VeyraX Memory:

### Manual Addition via VeyraX Platform

You can manually add memory entries through the VeyraX platform:
1. Navigate to the [VeyraX Integrations](https://www.veyrax.com/integrations) section.
2. Select the VeyraX Memory tool.

4. Save it.

### Ask Agent to Save

Because [VeyraX Memory](https://www.veyrax.com/marketplace/veyrax) is just a tool, it also has methods available for the Agent to call. Simply ask the Agent to remember something important by using phrases like:
- "Add this to your memory..."
- "Remember that..."
- "Store this information..."

The agent will confirm when the information has been saved to memory.

Next time, the agent will already know this, allowing you to skip specifying the database, user ID, and other personal details. It's very simple now.
