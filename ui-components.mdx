Dynamic frontend rendering enables rapid, flexible, and safe frontend updates without requiring redeployments.

### How it Works:

#### Backend Sends a JSON Contract

Each tool or widget from the backend is described using a clear JSON contract:

```json
{
  "name": "SummaryCard",
  "jsx": "(props) => React.createElement('div', { className: 'p-4 bg-blue-100 rounded' }, props.safeSubstring(props.text, 0, 100))",
  "props": {
    "text": "Dynamic backend-generated content."
  }
}
```
- `name`: Identifier for logging or debugging.
- `jsx`: A string representation of a JavaScript function returning a React element.
- `props`: Backend-generated props passed directly to the component.

#### Frontend Parses and Prepares for Rendering

The frontend receives and parses this JSON structure using a dedicated renderer:

```jsx
<DynamicComponentRender component={componentData} />
```

This renderer seamlessly supports both single components and arrays:

```jsx
const components = Array.isArray(component) ? component : [component];
```

#### Isolated Rendering via SingleComponent
Each received component is rendered independently using the SingleComponent renderer, allowing robust error handling:


```jsx
components.map((comp, index) => (
  <SingleComponent key={index} component={comp} />
))
```

This ensures that if one component encounters an error, others remain unaffected.


#### Secure Runtime JSX Execution
The JSX string received from the backend is securely converted and executed as a real JavaScript function at runtime:

```jsx
const ComponentFunction = new Function('React', 'props', safeExecute);
return ComponentFunction(React, component.props);
```
How does this work?
- JSX strings are dynamically converted into executable JavaScript functions at runtime.
- Protective helper functions like safeSubstring are injected to ensure robustness against unexpected data inputs.
- Backend-generated props are immediately available within the component function as standard React props.


Example of a runtime-executed component:

```jsx
const Comp = (props) => React.createElement(
  'div',
  { className: 'p-4 bg-blue-100 rounded' },
  props.safeSubstring(props.text, 0, 100)
);

return Comp(enhancedProps);
```

This technique allows developers to rapidly introduce new tools or widgets without needing frontend redeployments or extensive additional type definitions, significantly accelerating the development and deployment process.
