HTTP Request tool helps you test APIs directly from IDE. Whether you're developing a Node.js or Python application, you can easily test your endpoints during development.

## Testing Local Development APIs

When developing locally, you'll need ngrok to make your local server accessible. Here's how to set it up:

### For Node.js Applications

1. Start your Node.js server (typically runs on port 3000):

```bash
npm start
# or
node server.js
# Your API is now running on http://localhost:3000
```

2. Install and run ngrok:

```bash
# Install ngrok globally
npm install -g ngrok

# Start ngrok (in a new terminal)
ngrok http 3000
```

3. Copy the https URL from ngrok (looks like `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

4. Now in Cursor, you can test your endpoint by asking the agent:

```bash
@http_request test my endpoint POST https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/users with this body {"name": "test"}
```

### For Python Applications

1. Start your Python server (example with Flask on port 5000):

```bash
# Start your Flask/FastAPI server
python app.py
# Your API is now running on http://localhost:5000
```

2. Install and run ngrok:

```bash
# Install ngrok (macOS)
brew install ngrok
# or download from https://ngrok.com/download

# Start ngrok
ngrok http 5000
```

3. Copy the https URL from ngrok

4. Test in IDE:

```bash
@http_request test my Flask endpoint GET https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/data
```

## Why ngrok?

- Your local server (`localhost:3000` or `localhost:5000`) isn't accessible from the internet
- ngrok creates a secure tunnel and gives you a public URL
- This public URL can be used to test your local API endpoints
- No need to deploy to test your APIs

## Common Testing Scenarios

Ask the agent to:

```bash
# Basic GET request
@http_request test GET https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/users

# POST with JSON body
@http_request test POST https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/users with body {"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}

# With headers
@http_request test POST https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/protected with header Authorization: Bearer your-token

# With query parameters
@http_request test GET https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/search?query=test
```

The agent will help you format the request correctly and show you the response.

Remember: Always use the ngrok URL (https://abc123.ngrok.io) instead of localhost when testing through the HTTP Request tool.
