Veyrax is a platform that provides streamlined access to tool integrations for AI agent systems, complete with UI components. We identified a fundamental problem: setting up tool integrations is extremely complex due to numerous endpoints, different serialization methods, and diverse data structures that require handling on both frontend and backend.

Our core solution is simple yet powerful: a single endpoint that accepts any parameters, eliminating the need for developers to worry about Zod functions or data models. You simply specify three things:
- `get_tool`: all tools that Agent has access to;
- `tool-call`: executuion of the tool; 
- `UI component`: display your data as UI without any effort. 

This approach delivers immediate results - UI components are automatically generated, and the system response is returned to the agent in a format it understands. The platform uses clear abstractions described in our core concepts.

By abstracting away integration complexities, Veyrax lets developers focus on building intelligent agents that deliver real value to users.
