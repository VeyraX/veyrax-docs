# Connecting Your MCP Tools

VeyraX provides flexible options for connecting MCP tools, whether you've just deployed your own or want to use existing ones from our marketplace. This guide explains how to connect and access these tools.

## Connection Methods

### 1. Connect Your Recently Deployed Tool

When you deploy an MCP tool using VeyraX, it's automatically connected to your account. You can immediately access it through:

- The VeyraX API (using `/get-tools` and `/tool-call` endpoints)
- The VeyraX CLI for specific client integration

Use the unique installation command provided in your deployment dashboard:

```bash
npx @veyrax/mcp-cli install <process-id> <your-api-key> --client <client-name>
```

**Important**: This installation link is unique and works exclusively with your API key. Be careful when sharing this command as it contains your personal credentials.

### 2. Connect Marketplace MCP Tools

1. Go to the [VeyraX marketplace](https://www.veyrax.com/integrations?tab=mcps)
2. Browse and select any MCP tool
3. Click the "Connect" button

5. Receive your unique installation link
