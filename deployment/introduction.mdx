---

VeyraX allows you to seamlessly deploy any MCP-compatible GitHub repository with a Dockerfile in just a few steps. Our deployment system is designed to eliminate the complexity typically involved in deploying custom tools to model context protocols (MCP), such as those used in Claude, Cursor, VS Code, or Windserf.

## What is Deployment?

Deployment via VeyraX is the process of turning any GitHub-based MCP tool into a live, usable endpoint. Whether you're creating a new tool or integrating an existing one, our deployment platform ensures you can:

- Deploy tools in under 2 minutes;
- Run tools in either stdio or sse mode;
- Use the deployed tool standalone or within your existing VeyraX toolset;
- Connect instantly through our native integration with all MCP clients.

Once deployed, tools can be accessed through your tool list and called via standard methods like vrx.getTools() and toolCall().

## Getting Started
