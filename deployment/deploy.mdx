# Deploying Your MCP Tools

Deploying MCP-compatible tools should be simple and straightforward. With VeyraX, we've streamlined the entire process to make deployment as painless as possible. Our platform handles all the complex infrastructure setup, containerization, and scaling, allowing you to focus on what matters - building amazing tools.

In this guide, we'll walk through the complete process of taking your GitHub repository and turning it into a live, accessible MCP tool that can be used across all supported platforms and integrated with your existing workflows.

## Deployment Methods

VeyraX supports three methods for deploying your MCP tools, listed in order of reliability:

### 1. veyrax.yaml Configuration (Recommended)

The most reliable method is to include a `veyrax.yaml` file in your repository's root. This configuration file gives VeyraX precise instructions on how to build and run your tool.

Example `veyrax.yaml`:

```yaml
name: VeyraX
description: "Single MCP tool to connect 100+ tools: Gmail, Calendar and more."
base_image: node:22.14.0-alpine
project_directory: /app
install_command: npm install
build_command: npm run build
start_command: node dist/index.js
env:
  VEYRAX_API_KEY: config.VEYRAX_API_KEY
```

#### Generate Your veyrax.yaml

VeyraX offers an online [YAML Generator tool](https://www.veyrax.com/deployment/generate-yaml) that can create a veyrax.yaml file based on your repository structure. Simply input your repository URL, and the tool will analyze your project and generate an appropriate configuration file that you can download and add to your repository.

### 2. Dockerfile

If your repository has a Dockerfile in the root directory, VeyraX will automatically detect and use it for deployment. This is a good option if you already have Docker set up for your project.

We won't attempt to modify or generate a Dockerfile - we'll use exactly what you've provided in your repository.

### 3. AI-Generated Configuration (Not Recommended)

If neither a `veyrax.yaml` nor a Dockerfile is found, VeyraX will analyze your project structure and attempt to create a deployment configuration automatically.

While this can work for simple projects, it's not recommended for production deployments as it may not correctly capture all requirements.

## Step-by-Step Deployment Flow

### 1. Access the VeyraX Deployment UI
Go to the [deployment section](https://www.veyrax.com/deployment/create) of the VeyraX platform.

### 2. Insert a GitHub Repository URL
- You can choose any public repository with MCP.
- Make sure the repository includes a Dockerfile. Any working Dockerfile is acceptable.
- Currently, only public repositories are supported.

### 3. Fetch Data
- You can either paste your GitHub URL directly or search from our extensive list of existing repositories.
- Click Fetch to start repository inspection.

### 4. Set Environment Variables
- After fetching, VeyraX auto-detects required environment variables for your project.
- Fill in the required values directly in the UI.

### 5. Click Deploy
- Once your environment is configured, the Deploy button becomes active.
- Click it to initiate deployment. This takes about 2 minutes.

### 6. Monitor Deployment Status
- Go to the Development tab to observe the deployment progress.
- Possible statuses: building, ready, failed.

### 7. Access Your MCP Instance
- After the deployment completes, the Overview tab will show a link to your running instance.
- This instance is now live and callable via all VeyraX-supported methods.

## MCP Access

Your deployed instance is MCP-compatible and immediately usable in:
- Cursor IDE
- Claude
- Windserf
- VS Code (via CLI integration)
- via any other MCP-compatiable client

You can also integrate it with your existing VeyraX agents and workflows.

## Additional Notes

**Rollbacks**: If you need to revert to a previous version, simply redeploy the same repository, by default we take last commit.

## Summary

Deploying tools with VeyraX is fast, simple, and powerful:
- Paste any valid GitHub URL with a Dockerfile;
- Let us auto-detect your env vars;
- Deploy and connect in minutes;
- Access the tool in your preferred MCP environment instantly.

Whether you're testing a new agent, extending your tool stack, or deploying production-ready endpoints â€” VeyraX makes MCP deployment effortless.
