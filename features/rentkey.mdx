## What is Provider API Key Rental?

Provider API Key Rental allows you to use external tools through VeyraX's own API keys rather than requiring you to obtain and configure your own. This feature is available to all users with a **Pro** tier subscription.

When you rent a provider API key:
- You're using VeyraX's account credentials for the tool
- Usage costs are covered by your VeyraX subscription
- API requests are routed through our systems

## Available Tools

Pro subscribers can access these external services using VeyraX's API keys:

- Perplexity
- Browser Use
- YouTube
- Google Maps
- OpenWeather
- FireCrawl
- Tavily
- Exa
- E2B
- Revid AI
- Replicate
- Brave Search
- Hunter.io
- Bannerbear

## How to Use Rented API Keys

1. Navigate to the Integrations section in VeyraX
2. Find the tool you want to use
3. Click the "Connect" button
4. Click "Rent Key" in the connection dialog

5. The tool will now be available for use in your workflows

## Important Limitations

- **Usage Restrictions**: If our systems detect unusual or excessive usage patterns, access may be temporarily limited
- **Access to Private Resources**: Functions that create or list private resources (such as "list variants" or similar) will not be available with rented keys, as these would allow access to resources created by other users sharing the same key

## Differences from Personal API Keys

When using rented keys versus your own API keys:

1. **Shared Resources**: You're using a shared pool of API requests
2. **No Configuration**: You don't need to handle API key rotation or management
3. **Limited Access**: You can't access provider dashboards or account settings
4. **Usage Caps**: Your usage will be capped based on your subscription level

If you require dedicated resources or higher usage limits â€” contact us.
