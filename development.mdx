### 1. Get Tools

The `/get-tools` endpoint serves as your agent's gateway to discovering available capabilities. Instead of manually coding integrations for each service, Veyrax provides a simple interface to:

- Discover all tools available in the system
- Identify which tools the current user has access to
- Retrieve the schema and documentation for each tool

```javascript
// Example: Discovering available tools
const response = await fetch('https://api.veyrax.com/get-tools', {
  headers: { 'VEYRAX_API_KEY': 'your_api_key' }
});

const { tools } = await response.json();
// tools = { "gmail": {...}, "slack": {...}, ... }
```

This eliminates the need to hardcode tool definitions in your agent, allowing for dynamic discovery of capabilities.

### 2. Tool Call

The universal `/tool-call/{tool}/{method}` endpoint is the heart of Veyrax. It provides a consistent interface for calling any tool method, regardless of the underlying service:

```javascript
// Example: Calling a tool method
const result = await fetch('https://api.veyrax.com/tool-call/gmail/send_email', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'VEYRAX_API_KEY': 'your_api_key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    recipient: 'user@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello from Veyrax',
    body: 'This is a test email'
  })
});
```

This unified approach means:
- No need to implement separate API clients for each service
- Consistent error handling across all tools
- Automatic authentication and token refresh

### 3. UI Components

What truly sets Veyrax apart is the automatic UI component generation. When a tool is called, the response includes not just data, but also ready-to-render UI components:

```javascript
// Example response structure
{
  "data": {
    // Raw data from the tool
    "messages": [...]
  },
  "component": {
    // Ready-to-render UI component
    "jsx": "...",
    "props": {...}
  }
}
```

These components can be directly rendered in your frontend without any additional implementation:

```jsx
<DynamicComponentRender component={response.component} />
```

This eliminates the need to:
- Design and implement UI for each tool's data
- Write data transformation logic
- Handle edge cases in data display

### How They Work Together

The beauty of Veyrax lies in how these three elements work together:

1. Your agent discovers available tools via `/get-tools`
2. It makes calls to those tools via `/tool-call/{tool}/{method}`
3. The response includes both data and UI components
4. Your frontend renders these components automatically

This creates a seamless flow from tool discovery to beautiful data visualization, all with minimal code.
