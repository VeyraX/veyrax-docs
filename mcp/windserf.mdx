### Add MCP Configuration

Add the following configuration to your MCP config file. You'll need to paste the command with your VeyraX API key that you can copy from the [VeyraX Platform](https://www.veyrax.com/agent/new).

The configuration will look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@VeyraX-veyrax-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@smithery/cli@latest",
        "run",
        "@VeyraX/veyrax-mcp",
        "--config",
        "\"{\\\"VEYRAX_API_KEY\\\":\\\"YOUR_VEYRAX_API_KEY\\\"}\""
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
