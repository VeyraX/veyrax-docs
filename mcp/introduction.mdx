The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that allows you to provide custom tools to agentic LLMs.

It lets you use all tools you've already connected in VeyraX in any MCP-compatible environment — Claude, Cursor, VS Code, or Windserf.

## Why to choose VeyraX over others?

- **Single Authentication**: Connect once in VeyraX, use everywhere — no need to authenticate tools separately in each environment;
- **Instant Access to All Tools**: All tools connected in VeyraX are immediately available in your favorite editor or AI assistant;
- **5-Minute Setup**: Connect VeyraX to any MCP client in under 5 minutes;


## Getting Started

1. [Sign up for VeyraX](https://www.veyrax.com/register);
2. Open the [VeyraX Platform](https://www.veyrax.com/agent/new) to get your API key;

3. Choose your configuration - you can copy the complete configuration with your API key directly from the platform;

4. Choose your preferred MCP client from below;
5. Follow the setup guide (takes less than 5 minutes);

You can either use the automatic installation method which will prompt you for your API key, or manually add the configuration copied from the VeyraX platform.
