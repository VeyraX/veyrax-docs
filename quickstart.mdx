To get started with VeyraX â€” you will need an `API KEY`. You can find it on the platform in your [account settings](https://www.veyrax.com/agent/new).

## Step 0: Connect Tools

Before using VeyraX tools, you need to connect the services you want to integrate. Visit the [VeyraX Integrations page](https://www.veyrax.com/integrations) where you can find and connect a wide variety of tools and services. Simply browse through the extensive catalog of available integrations, select the ones you need, and follow the authentication process to connect them to your VeyraX account.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Step 2: Configure Your API Key

```python
import requests

# API configuration
VEYRAX_API_KEY = '<YOUR_VEYRAX_API_KEY>'
headers = {'VEYRAX_API_KEY': VEYRAX_API_KEY}
```

## Step 3: Call a VeyraX Tool

Now you can call any connected tool through the VeyraX platform. Here's an example of starring a GitHub repository:

```python
# API configuration
base_url = 'https://veyraxapp.com/tool-call'

# Request details
url = f"{base_url}/github/star_repository"
payload = {"owner": "VeyraX", "repo": "quick-start-python"}

# Make request and print results
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Response: {response.json()}")
```

The response will include both the data and a React component that can be directly rendered in your frontend:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Repository starred successfully"
  },
  "component": {
    "name": "ToolWrapper",
    "props": {
      "toolName": "github",
      "children": {
        "name": "GitHubActionResult",
        "props": {
          "data": {
            "success": true,
            "message": "Repository starred successfully"
          }
        },
        "jsx": "..."
      }
    },
    "jsx": "..."
  }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

For more complex scenarios, you can:

1. Fetch all available tools using the `/get-tools` endpoint
2. Use AI to determine which tool to call based on user input
3. Chain multiple tool calls together for complex workflows
